# Marine-Predators-Algorithm
This Python implementation of the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) is designed to solve both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. The algorithm is inspired by the strategies of marine predators in nature, focusing on the balance between exploration and exploitation phases to effectively search the solution space.
